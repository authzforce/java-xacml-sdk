/**
 * This class handles collections of <code>AbstractPolicy</code> instances,
 * and provides some commonly useful operations. Specifically, it lets you
 * retrieve matching policies (based on reference or context), it optionally
 * handles wrapping multiple matches under a single PolicySet, and it manages
 * different versions of policies correctly. This class is intended for use
 * as a backing store to <code>PolicyFinderModule</code>s, but in practice
 * may have many uses.
 * <p>
 * Note that this class will accept multiple versions of the same policy. This
 * means that when you retieve a policy by reference, you will get the
 * correct version. It also means that when you retrieve a policy based on
 * context, there may be multiple revisions of the same policy, any number
 * of which may apply. Generally speaking, the correct behavior here is not
 * to return all of these policies, since they are (virtually speaking) the
 * same policy, but may have conflicting rules. So, as a simplification, and
 * to handle the most common cases, only the most recent version of a policy
 * is returned in these cases. If you need a more complex solution, you
 * will need to implement it yourself. Because the support modules use this
 * class as their backing store, this is true also of those modules.
 * <p>
 * Note that this is not a heavily optimized class. It is intended more as
 * an example, support code for the finder modules, and a starting utility
 * for other programmers than as an enterprise-quality implementation. That
 * said, it is fully functional, and should be useful for many applications.
