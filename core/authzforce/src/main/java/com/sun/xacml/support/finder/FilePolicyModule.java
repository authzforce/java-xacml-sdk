/**
 * This module represents a collection of files containing polices,
 * each of which will be searched through when trying to find a
 * policy that is applicable to a specific request. It does not support
 * policy references.
 * <p>
 * Note that this class used to be provided in the
 * <code>com.sun.xacml.finder.impl</code> package with a warning that it
 * would move out of the core packages eventually. This is partly because
 * this class doesn't represent standard functionality, and partly because
 * it isn't designed to be generally useful as anything more than an
 * example. Because so many people have used this class, however, it stayed
 * in place until the 2.0 release.
 * <p>
 * As of the 2.0 release, you may still use this class (in its new location),
 * but you are encouraged to migrate to the new support modules that are
 * much richer and designed for general-purpose use. Also, note that the
 * <code>loadPolicy</code> methods that used to be available from this class
 * have been removed. That functionality has been replaced by the much more
 * useful <code>PolicyReader</code> class. If you need to load policies
 * directly, you should consider that new class.
