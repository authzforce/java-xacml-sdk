/**
 * This module supports references made with resolvable URLs (eg, http or
 * file pointers). No policies are cached. Instead, all policy references are
 * resolved in real-time. To make this module as generally applicable as
 * possible, no errors are ever returned when attempting to resolve a
 * policy. This means that if a resolved policy is invalid, a server cannot
 * be contacted, etc., this module simply reports that it cannot provide a
 * policy. If you need to report errors, or support any caching, you have to
 * write your own implementation.
 * <p>
 * This module is provided as an example, but is still fully functional, and
 * should be useful for many simple applications. This is provided in the
 * <code>support</code> package rather than the core codebase because it
 * implements non-standard behavior.
