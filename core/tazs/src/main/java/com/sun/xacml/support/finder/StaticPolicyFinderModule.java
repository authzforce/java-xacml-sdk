/**
 * This is a simple implementation of <code>PolicyFinderModule</code> that
 * supports retrieval based on context, and is designed for use with a
 * run-time configuration. Its constructor accepts a <code>List</code> of
 * <code>String</code>s that represent URLs or files, and these are resolved
 * to policies when the module is initialized. Beyond this, there is no
 * modifying or re-loading the policies represented by this class. This
 * class will optionally wrap multiple applicable policies into a dynamic
 * PolicySet.
 * <p>
 * Note that this class is designed to complement
 * <code>StaticRefPolicyFinderModule</code>. It would be easy to support both
 * kinds of policy retrieval in a single class, but the functionality is
 * instead split between two classes. The reason is that when you define a
 * configuration for your PDP, it's easier to specify the two sets of policies
 * by using two different finder modules. Typically, there aren't many
 * policies that exist in both sets, so loading the sets separately isn't
 * a problem. If this is a concern to you, simply create your own class and
 * merge the two existing classes.
 * <p>
 * This module is provided as an example, but is still fully functional, and
 * should be useful for many simple applications. This is provided in the
 * <code>support</code> package rather than the core codebase because it
 * implements non-standard behavior.
