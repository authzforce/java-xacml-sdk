/**
 * This is a simple, command-line driven XACML PDP. It acts both as an example
 * of how to write a full-featured PDP and as a sample program that lets you
 * evaluate requests against policies. See the comments for the main() method
 * for correct usage.
 * <p>
 * As of the 2.0 release, this has been moved into the new support tree of the
 * codebase. It has also been updated to use several of the new finder
 * modules provided in the support tree codebase, so that static and dynamic
 * references are supported, policies can be loaded from URLs, top-level
 * policies are wrapped in a policy set when more than one applies, etc.
 * <p>
 * If you don't use a configuration file, then the default modules can all
 * optionally support schema validation. To turn this on, provide the filename
 * of the schema file in the property "com.sun.xacml.PolicySchema". You can
 * also turn this on if you use a configuration file and it includes the
 * modules provided in the support package.
