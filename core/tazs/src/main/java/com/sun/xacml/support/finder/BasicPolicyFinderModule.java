/**
 * This is a basic implementation of <code>PolicyFinderModule</code> that
 * accepts already created <code>AbstractPolicy</code>s and supports
 * finding by context and reference. All policies are held forever once
 * added to this module, and cannot be refreshed or removed. New policies
 * may be added at any point. You may optionally specify a combining
 * algorithm to use when more than one applicable policy is found, and then
 * a new PolicySet is wrapped around the policies using this algorithm. If
 * no combining algorithm is provided, then an error is returned if more
 * than one policy matches.
 * <p>
 * This module is provided as an example, but is still fully functional, and
 * should be useful for many simple applications. This is provided in the
 * <code>support</code> package rather than the core codebase because it
 * implements non-standard behavior.
